1. Set the I_AM_DEBUGGING flags to false and GAMES_TO_PLAY to 10. Run the ElevensSimulation program a few times and record the percentage of games won for each run. What is the range of win percentages that you saw? Were the percentages fairly consistent, or did they vary quite a bit? 2. Increase the number of games to play to 100. Are the win percentages more consistent from run  to run? 
In the simulation file, by doing a couple of 10 games, I got one simulation to get 1 game won. In another trial I did it another time and there were none, and a couple more and no games were won. I set the number of games to 30 and again only 1 game won. On 100 games 1 games won. According to wikipedia there is a .2% chance of winning any given game of elevens.

2. Experiment with simulating different numbers of games. How many games do you need to play in order to get consistent results from run to run? 
I did 500 and got about 1 games won consistantly. If you could run 10,000 you may be able to get 3-4 games won consistantly by I can't run it.
